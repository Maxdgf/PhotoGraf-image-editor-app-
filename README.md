Photo editor "Photographf" application

This is my first application written in python using the pyqt5 library.
Do not judge strictly!)

I've been writing this project for a long time. Unfortunately, a small part of the code that controlled the 3 buttons for editing photos was lost, but the executable exe file itself remained.
PhotoGraf can edit photos with extensions (png, jpg, bmp, jpeg, svg)

To edit a photo, just select one folder with a photo and after editing the photo is automatically saved to the "Modified images" subfolder.
