ImageEditor "PhotoGraf" app project

This is my first python app project on pyqt5.
Do not judge strictly!)

I wrote this project a long time ago, unfortunately a small part of the code has not been preserved, namely 3 photo editing buttons, but even without that, the project turned out to be pretty good for a person who has just embarked on the path of application development. I personally wrote this project myself.

PhotoGraf can edit photos(png, jpg, bmp, jpeg, svg)

To edit a photo, just select the folder with the photo. After editing, the photo is automatically saved to the "Modified Images" subfolder.

Requirements:

1) pqt5 library (pip install pyqt5)
2) pillow library (pip install pillow)
3) tkinter library (pip install tkinter)->!not necessary!
